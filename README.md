# Graph Construction:

After the process on query space for getting QT, EAT, Keywords (RT) and Constraints, the process moves to the ontology space for first mapping variables to ontology entities (classes, slots, and instances) and then expanding upwards the classes and going from classes to instances.
Once completed the construction of the graph representing the variables (nodes corresponding to classes and instances) and the relations (edges) expressed in the constraints extracted from the question.

Each components are released in their own branch. Check each componets's README for more information.
